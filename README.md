In the game Alien Invasion, players control an armed spaceship that initially appears at the bottom center of the screen. Players can use the directional keys to move the spaceship left and right, and use the spacebar to shoot. When the game starts, an alien fleet appears in the sky and moves towards the bottom of the screen. The player's task is to eliminate these aliens. After the player eliminates all the aliens, a new alien fleet will appear with faster movement speed. As long as an alien collides with the player's spaceship or reaches the bottom edge of the screen, the player loses one spaceship. After the player loses three spaceships, the game ends.
